# Various scripts for examples and/or experiments in various languages

Finally created this as often I need to access this as my "bank of knowledges".  
What is the "bank of knowledges" meaning? It is the examples or topics or cases
that I did previously but need to offload it off from my immediate memory.
Hence when I want to access again, I need to see this again and work from it.

The primary example of this, is like in this scenario. I have to do task that I've done
it before. I remember vaguely on how to solve it and can work it out from scratch again
using the same method for solving the task before.  
While I can still do it, it's better to consult my previous work to have better velocity
on working the same case anymore. Often I find this method will save 3/4 time when
done it by scratch once again.

Now it's put in Github repo because apparently there's a need to access this from another
device. So this is the repo about.
