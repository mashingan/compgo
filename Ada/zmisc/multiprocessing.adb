--Problem:
  --How to make N computations (e.g. compute the determinants of ten 5x5
  --matrices) in parallel using the  multiprocessing capabilities of Ada
  --(and of your implicit parallel computer).

-- Here is one solution.  I have taken the liberty of abstracting out
-- the "messy" tasking business inside a reusable generic package and
-- adding a support package to output elapsed seconds with each print
-- statement.  This solution works both for Ada-83 and Ada-95.
